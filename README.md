<h2>STOPWATCH<h2/>
<h4>
<br>In this project,my main aim was to demonstrate how to interface an LCD to the Raspberry Pi Pico board<br/>
<br>Later I built a stop watch with two buttons: Start/Pause Button and a Reset Button<br/>
<br><br/>
<br>PS:<br/>
<br>I had to download two libraries to interface the LCD to the Pico board<br/>
